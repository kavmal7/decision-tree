## Decision tree
In this code file, we manually implement a decision tree algorithm, namely the ID3 (iterative dichotomiser 3) algorithm. We include the possibility to use entropy or gini impurity, and we include a form of regularisation in reduced-error pruning. We then use our model and compare it against Scikit-learn's decision tree classifier, comparing the performance and runtimes of both implementations. A random forest classifier implementation (using this) is in the works.
